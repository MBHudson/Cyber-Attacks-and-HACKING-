WEB HACKING - BLACK BELT EDITION

NotSoSecure is pleased to launch their much awaited advanced Web Hacking class. 
Much like the Advanced Infrastructure Hacking class, this class talks about 
a wealth of hacking techniques to compromise web applications, APIs and associated end-points. 
This class focus on specific areas of app-sec and on advanced vulnerability identification 
and exploitation techniques (especially server side flaws). 
The class allows attendees to practice some neat, new and ridiculous hacks 
which affected real life products and have found a mention in real bug-bounty programs. 
The vulnerabilities selected for the class either typically go undetected by modern scanners or 
the exploitation techniques are not so well known. Attendees will also benefit from a state-of-art Hacklab 
and we will be providing free 30 days lab access after the class to allow attendees more practice time.
