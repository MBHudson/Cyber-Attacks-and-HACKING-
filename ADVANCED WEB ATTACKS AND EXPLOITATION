ADVANCED WEB ATTACKS AND EXPLOITATION

The days of porous network perimeters are fading fast as externally 
facing services become more resilient and harder to exploit. 

In order to gain that critical initial foothold in a network, 
penetration testers must be fluent in the art of exploiting front-facing web applications.

Offensive Security's Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (AWAE) Course 
was created by taking widely deployed web applications found in many enterprises and actively exploiting them. 

This intensive, hands-on course takes your skills well beyond standard SQL injection or file inclusion attacks 
and will propel you into a world of mind-bending, blinded, SQL Injection, illogical authentication bypasses, 
heavy deserialization, and pass-the-hash web authentication weaknesses all chained to gain remote code execution unassisted. 
And that's just scratching the surface.

Topics covered include:

Advanced web application source code auditing
Non-interaction XSS attacks and exotic payloads
Leveraging CSRF attacks to achieve virtually unassisted remote code execution
State of the art SQL injection attacks (time based blind)
Authentication weakness/bypass attacks
Bypassing character restrictions in payloads
Command injection attacks
Java deserialization of untrusted data exploitation
PHP Object injection (attacking PHP's state machine)
Exotic file inclusion attacks (non PHP environments)
Multi-step, chained attacks making use of multiple vulnerabilities
Real world attacks on widely deployed network infrastructure applications.
...and more!
